# TheMove
The Move is a full stack mobile app to help college students better plan their nights. Students can view the most popular places to hang out on a day by day basis. Users can view others' plans as well as vote on their plans. 
The Move utilizes python as the front end and back end. 
This project is currently in development, and is expected to be completed by early October. Rishi Sajay is the primary developer and project manager. 

Versions 1 and 2 utilize socket programming. As the app grew more and more complex, this methods of cummincation between the client and server grew frustrating, so I switched to Django (Version 3). I utilized Django to create an API that the client communicates with via API requests.

Completed: Backend is nearly complete. Frontend is fully functional and fully communicates with the backend. 

To do: 
Improve upon the UI.
Publicly host the server and communicate to clients.
Package the app for android and ios.
