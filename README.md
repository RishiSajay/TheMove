# TheMove
The Move is a full stack mobile app to help college students better plan their nights. Students can view the most popular places to hang out on a day by day basis. Users can view others' plans as well as vote on their plans. 
The Move utilizes python as the front end and back end. 
This project is currently in development, and is expected to be completed by late August. Rishi Sajay is the primary developer and Thomas Caliguire is the project manager.
