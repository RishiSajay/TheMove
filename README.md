# TheMove
The Move is a full stack mobile app to help college students better plan their nights. Students can view the most popular places to hang out on a day by day basis. Users can view others' plans as well as vote on their plans. 
The Move utilizes python as the front end and back end. 
This project is currently in development, and is expected to be completed by late August. Rishi Sajay is the primary developer and Thomas Caliguire is the project manager. 

Completed: The backend and communication between multiple clients and the server are fully functional on a local network. Users can login and vote on their plans, as well as view other people's votes. A funcional UI has also been implemented. 

To do: 
Improve upon the UI.
Publicly host the server and communicate to clients.
Package the app for android and ios.
