# TheMove
The Move is a full stack mobile app to help college students better plan their nights. Students can view the most popular places to hang out on a day by day basis. Users can view others' plans as well as vote on their plans. 
The Move utilizes python as the front end and back end. 


Versions 1 and 2 utilize socket programming. Version 3 uses Django instead. I utilized Django to create an API that the client communicates with via API requests.

Version 3 is the most recent and up to date version.
